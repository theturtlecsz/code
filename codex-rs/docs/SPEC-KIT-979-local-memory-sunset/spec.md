## Why This Redirect Exists

Per SPEC.md guidance on documentation drift elimination, SPEC documents are maintained in `docs/` (repo root), not `codex-rs/docs/` (Rust crate documentation).

The `codex-rs/docs/` directory is reserved for:
- Rust crate-specific documentation
- ADRs specific to the Rust workspace
- Architecture docs for Rust components only
