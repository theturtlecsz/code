# SPEC.md - Canonical Location Redirect

> **⚠️ THIS FILE IS A STUB**

The canonical SPEC.md is located at:

**[`codex-rs/SPEC.md`](codex-rs/SPEC.md)**

This stub exists for backward compatibility. All task tracking, invariants, and docs contract
information is maintained in the canonical location.

## Why?

To eliminate documentation drift between duplicate files (see SPEC-KIT-979 phase work).
The `codex-rs/` directory is the single source of truth for:

- Task tracking (`SPEC.md`)
- Documentation lint (`scripts/doc_lint.py`)
- Model policy (`model_policy.toml`)
