# Workflow Pattern 1: Rapid Prototyping
#
# Use Case: Proof-of-concept development, exploration, throwaway code
# Strategy: Skip validation stages to iterate quickly, focus on implementation
#
# Benefits:
# - Fast iteration cycles (implement → test manually → iterate)
# - Low cost for experimental features
# - No formal validation overhead for prototypes
#
# Trade-offs:
# - No automated test coverage (validate skipped)
# - No compliance checks (audit skipped)
# - No production readiness validation (unlock skipped)
# - Quality gates still active (plan + tasks checkpoints)

[pipeline]
spec_id = "SPEC-XXX"  # Replace with your SPEC ID

# Enabled stages (5 of 8 total)
enabled_stages = ["new", "specify", "plan", "tasks", "implement"]

# Quality gate configuration
[quality_gates]
enabled = true  # Keep quality gates for plan/tasks validation
auto_resolve = true  # Auto-resolve unanimous agent agreement

# Optional: Skip reasons for documentation
[skip_reasons]
validate = "Prototype: no automated tests needed yet"
audit = "Low-risk experimental feature, skip compliance checks"
unlock = "Not ready for production deployment"

# Cost Analysis (Post-SPEC-949 pricing)
# ==========================================
# Full pipeline:        $2.71  (~50 min)
# This workflow:        $0.66  (~20 min)
# Savings:             $2.05  (~30 min)
# Reduction:              76%      60%
#
# Cost Breakdown:
# - new:      $0.00 (native, instant)
# - specify:  $0.10 (1 agent, gpt5-low, ~3-5 min)
# - plan:     $0.35 (3 agents, multi-agent consensus, ~10-12 min)
# - tasks:    $0.10 (1 agent, gpt5-low, ~3-5 min)
# - implement: $0.11 (2 agents, gpt-5-codex + validator, ~8-12 min)

# Time Breakdown:
# - new:      <1 min (native SPEC-ID generation)
# - specify:  ~4 min (PRD refinement)
# - plan:     ~11 min (work breakdown)
# - tasks:    ~4 min (task decomposition)
# - implement: ~10 min (code generation)
# Total: ~20 min (vs ~50 min full pipeline)

# Example Usage:
# ==============
# 1. Create this config:
#    cp docs/spec-kit/workflow-examples/rapid-prototyping.toml docs/SPEC-947/pipeline.toml
#
# 2. Run pipeline:
#    /speckit.auto SPEC-947
#
# 3. Or use CLI override (one-time):
#    /speckit.auto SPEC-947 --skip-validate --skip-audit --skip-unlock
