# ADR 0010: Proposal inbox ranking and pruning

## Context
Continuous research risks overwhelming users.

## Decision
Proposal inbox categories: Architecture/Refactors, Spec/Template Improvements.
Ranking factors: alignment with sacred intent+criteria; expected score gain; security; cost; evidence quality.
Pruning: merge duplicates; archive after 7 days; keep top 10 per category visible.

## Consequences
- Calm, bounded UX.
- Research becomes actionable rather than spammy.
