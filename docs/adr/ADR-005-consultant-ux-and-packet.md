# ADR 0005: Consultant-first UX with Packet contract

## Context
Spec-Kit must feel like a consultant at the outset and become semi-autonomous after collecting a “magic packet” of context.

## Decision
We will implement a chat-first UX that progressively fills a structured Packet (Project Charter + Milestone Contract). The Packet is the execution contract, not a passive summary.

We will always do a recap before major execution shifts.

## Consequences
- Strong alignment and reduced thrash.
- Enables learning because runs can be keyed to structured Packet fields.
