# ADR 0008: Unattended mode behavior

## Context
Users are not always available; guidance must be non-blocking.

## Decision
User presence is toggle + inactivity. When unattended: no merges; research/review/prototyping only. Notifications are rare and high-signal, plus daily recap.

## Consequences
- Prevents overnight surprise merges.
- Still allows progress via prototypes and decision-ready options.
