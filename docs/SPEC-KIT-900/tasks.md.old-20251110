The scenario must remain simple, deterministic, and free of team-specific context so it can be executed repeatedly without review cycles.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Problem Statement\n\n- SPEC-KIT-070 and future routing experiments require a neutral baseline SPEC to compare premium vs. cheap-model runs.\n- Current validation often reuses the SPEC being modified, creating circular dependencies and biased prompts.\n- We need a stable script that any engineer can run to gather cost/quality evidence without touching roadmap artefacts.\n\n### Goals\n\n1. Provide canonical prompts for `/speckit.plan`, `/speckit.tasks`, `/speckit.validate` that yield medium-complexity outputs.\n2. Ensure each stage generates consensus artefacts, local-memory entries, and cost summaries by default.\n3. Keep content generic enough that reviewers can sign off quickly, yet structured enough to exercise agent reasoning.\n\n### Non-Goals\n\n[2025-11-03T02:42:59] tokens used: 8,009\n[2025-11-03T02:43:04] exec bash -lc \"sed -n '200,480p' docs/SPEC-KIT-900-generic-smoke/PRD.md\" in /home/thetu/code\n[2025-11-03T02:43:04] bash -lc \"sed -n '200,480p' docs/SPEC-KIT-900-generic-smoke/PRD.md\" succeeded in 14ms:\n- [ ] Plan includes timeline, risks, success metrics, and non-goals.\n- [ ] Task list counts between 8 and 12 items with clear parallelisation flags.\n- [ ] Validation plan enumerates tests, monitoring, rollback, and cost estimate.\n- [ ] Evidence directories populated (`commands/`, `consensus/`, `costs/`).\n- [ ] `cost_summary.json` shows three stage entries and total spend (matches schema above).\n\n---\n\n## 7. Rollout & Maintenance\n\n- Store this SPEC under version control (already in `docs/SPEC-KIT-900-generic-smoke/`).\n- Update prompts if major routing changes demand different agent scaffolding; log changes in `CHANGELOG.md` (future extension).\n- When a run is complete and data captured, archive evidence with `./scripts/evidence_archive.sh --spec SPEC-KIT-900` or remove via `rm` to keep the repository tidy.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Open Questions\n\n1. Should we add a dedicated `/speckit.auto` scenario (Implement + Validate) for longer benchmarks? — TBD.\n2. Do we need a CI harness to run this nightly with stubbed agents? — Out of scope for now.\n[2025-11-03T02:43:04] tokens used: 17,488\n[2025-11-03T02:43:09] exec bash -lc \"sed -n '1,260p' docs/SPEC-KIT-900-generic-smoke/spec.md\" in /home/thetu/code\n[2025-11-03T02:43:09] bash -lc \"sed -n '1,260p' docs/SPEC-KIT-900-generic-smoke/spec.md\" succeeded in 15ms:\n**SPEC-ID**: SPEC-KIT-900-generic-smoke\n**Feature**: Generic Multi-Agent Smoke Scenario\n**Status**: Ready for Testing\n**Created**: 2025-10-28\n**Branch**: feature/spec-kit-069-complete\n**Owner**: Code\n\n**Context**: This SPEC provides a neutral, design-agnostic workload that exercises `/speckit.plan`, `/speckit.tasks`, and `/speckit.validate` without touching production-sensitive content. It exists purely to benchmark orchestration behaviour (latency, model mix, cost) after router changes such as SPEC-KIT-070. Analysts can run the same scenario under different model configurations and compare evidence artifacts, cost summaries, and consensus quality without mutating real roadmap items.\n\n---\n\n## Test Objectives\n\n1. **Repeatability**: The prompts remain stable across runs so cost/quality deltas reflect routing changes, not domain shifts.\n2. **Coverage**: The scenario forces all three stages (plan, tasks, validate) to execute with typical agent output volume (~4-6k tokens per stage).\n3. **Neutrality**: Content is intentionally generic (\"launch sample productivity microservice\")—no team-specific jargon or confidential details.\n4. **Evidence Quality**: Each stage must emit consensus verdicts, local-memory entries, and `cost_summary.json` for downstream analysis.\n\n---\n\n[2025-11-03T02:43:09] tokens used: 27,311\n\n[2025-11-03T02:43:20] thinking\n\n**Evaluating schema differences**\n\nI noticed a discrepancy between the references in spec.md to scripts/spec_ops_004 and the guardrail path in PRD.

test scenarios defined |\n| 4-8 | **Core Service Implementation** | All CRUD endpoints functional, /sync handles conflicts, unit tests pass |\n| 6-9 | **Storage & Persistence** | SQLite schema deployed, migrations tested, connection pooling configured |\n| 8-10 | **Telemetry & Observability** | Metrics exported, structured logging in place, trace IDs propagated |\n| 10-12 | **Integration & Load Testing** | p95 ≤ 200ms @ 50 RPS, memory < 256MB, error rate < 1% |\n| 12-14 | **Documentation & Handoff** | API docs published, runbook created, knowledge transfer complete |\n\n### Critical Success Metrics\n- **REST API**: /reminders CRUD + /sync cross-device operations\n- **Performance**: p95 latency ≤ 200ms @ 50 RPS\n- **Memory**: < 256MB steady state\n- **Reliability**: Error rate < 1% over 5-minute window\n- **Telemetry**: Structured logging + Prometheus-format metrics export\n\n### Final Risk Register (5 Critical Items)\n1. **SQLite write contention** → WAL mode + connection pooling + write batching\n2. **Conflict resolution complexity** → Last-write-wins with vector clocks + edge case tests\n3. **2-week timeline buffer** → Strict MVP scope, daily standups, early blocker surfacing\n4. **Limited observability** → stdout metrics export + structured JSON logging + health checks\n5. **Data migration strategy** → sqlx migrations from day 1, schema versioning, rollback testing\n\n### Multi-Agent Consensus Achievements\n\n**Complete Alignment On:**\n- ✅ 2-week timeline feasibility with proper scope management\n- ✅ Rust/Axum/SQLite stack selection\n- ✅ Three-milestone structure (Design/Build/Validation)\n- ✅ Telemetry and rollback as critical requirements\n- ✅ API-first development with comprehensive testing\n\n**Conflicts Resolved:**\n- Task granularity (Gemini detailed vs Claude high-level) → 6-step breakdown balancing both\n- Observability approach (Claude external vs Gemini self-contained) → stdout metrics + future-proof design\n- Timeline estimates (Gemini 10d vs Claude 8d) → 9-day window with overlapping phases\n\n---\n\n## 📁 **Evidence Locations**\n\nThe following artifacts should be generated and stored:\n\n```\ndocs/SPEC-KIT-900-generic-smoke/\n├── plan.md (Final synthesized plan)\n├── PRD.md (Existing, reference)\n├── spec.md (Existing, reference)\n\ndocs/SPEC-OPS-004-integrated-coder-hooks/evidence/\n├── consensus/SPEC-KIT-900/\n│   ├── spec-plan_synthesis.json (Final arbiter output)\n│   ├── spec-plan_gemini_research.json (Research findings)\n│   ├── spec-plan_claude_synthesis.json (Work breakdown)\n│   └── spec-plan_consensus.json (All 3 agents)\n├── commands/SPEC-KIT-900/\n│   └── spec-plan_<timestamp>.json (Telemetry)\n└──

plan)\n```\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 **Recommended Next Steps**\n\n1. **Review final plan** against SPEC-KIT-900 acceptance criteria\n2. **Store consensus in local-memory** with tags: `spec:SPEC-KIT-900`, `stage:spec-plan`, `type:plan-synthesis`\n3. **Validate acceptance mapping** - all 7 test/check artifacts executable\n4. **Proceed to `/speckit.tasks`** stage with final plan as context\n5. **Monitor evidence footprint** - ensure under 25MB limit\n\n---\n\n**Plan Stage Complete** ✅  \n**All 3 agents aligned** ✅  \n**Ready for Tasks Stage** ✅\n",

Problem Statement\n\n- SPEC-KIT-070 and future routing experiments require a neutral baseline SPEC to compare premium vs. cheap-model runs.\n- Current validation often reuses the SPEC being modified, creating circular dependencies and biased prompts.\n- We need a stable script that any engineer can run to gather cost/quality evidence without touching roadmap artefacts.\n\n### Goals\n\n1. Provide canonical prompts for `/speckit.plan`, `/speckit.tasks`, `/speckit.validate` that yield medium-complexity outputs.\n2. Ensure each stage generates consensus artefacts, local-memory entries, and cost summaries by default.\n3. Keep content generic enough that reviewers can sign off quickly, yet structured enough to exercise agent reasoning.\n\n### Non-Goals\n\n[2025-11-03T02:47:44] tokens used: 8,534\n\n[2025-11-03T02:47:57] thinking\n\n**Evaluating improvement needs**\n\nI'm looking at different metrics for various tasks.

The third task's score is also 3.8, and clarity can be enhanced by defining how to calculate agreement percentages. \n\nOverall, there's room for improvements in every aspect examined.\n**Analyzing output guidelines**\n\nI’m reviewing the requirement for outputs to be free of confidential data and team-specific terms. The overall score here is 3.0, indicating there's definitely room for improvement. \n\nI suggest implementing lint-like automated scans and a list of prohibited terms to enhance specificity and testability, which currently sits low at 2.

The instructions mention that if a HAL HTTP MCP profile is set up, I should drive and archive outputs in the project's evidence folder. Given the environment limitations, I’ll look at the repo for docs related to SPEC-KIT-018-hal-http-mcp or the MCP client. I’ll also search for codex-mcp-client using rg. First, I’ll query local memory for SPEC-KIT-900 context and scan the repo for SPEC paths. Then, I’ll produce the three agent JSONs and proceed with a parallel search across domains.\n[2025-11-03T02:49:45] codex\n\nI’ll search local-memory for SPEC-KIT-900 context across domains and scan

Finding: **Arbiter not implemented** despite SPEC claim. Current: gpt_pro aggregator identifies conflicts, pipeline continues with `status: \\\"conflict\\\"`. Quality gate GPT-5 validation serves partial arbiter role (validates 2/3 majority, not full consensus conflicts). Evidence: 0% deadlocks observed (26 completed tasks, zero halts). Created CONFLICT_RESOLUTION.md documenting: current flow (gpt_pro as aggregator), conflict detection logic, quality gate comparison, arbiter design (SPEC_AUTO_FLOW.md), implementation priority (deferred, not blocking), honest SPEC vs reality assessment.

Quality commands now FREE vs $0.80 (100% reduction). **Phase 3 (Agent Optimization)**: Added gpt5-minimal/low/medium/high agents, separated gpt-5 (reasoning) from gpt-5-codex (code). Reduced specify/tasks to single agent ($0.30→$0.10, $0.20→$0.10). **Architecture Fixes**: Updated routing.rs (is_native_command check), slash_command.rs (is_prompt_expanding), app.rs (enum routing), chat_composer.rs (autocomplete filtering). **Cost Impact**: $11 → $2.71 per /speckit.auto (75% reduction). Monthly: $1,100 → $271 (saves $829/month). **Principle Validated**: \\\"Agents for reasoning, NOT transactions\\\" - pattern matching is native, strategic decisions use agents. **Files**: 4 native modules, 12 updated files, config cleanup. **Tests**: All quality commands validated on SPEC-KIT-900.

(1) **Fixed CLAUDE.md critical staleness**: Updated consensus automation status (line 21) from \\\"pending\\\" → \\\"OPERATIONAL\\\" with ARCH-004/MAINT-1 references, 5.3x performance note; updated date to 2025-10-19; added evidence footprint status. (2) **Created archive structure**: docs/archive/{2025-sessions, design-docs, completed-specs} with README.md policy. (3) **Archived 15 stale docs**: 11 from root (SESSION-HANDOFF, telemetry-tasks, plan.md, CONFIG_FIX, RESTART, output, model, 4 design docs), 4 from docs/spec-kit/ (SESSION_SUMMARY, etc.). Root reduced 30→19 files (-37%). (4) **Created docs/INDEX.md**: Navigation hub with Start Here, Policies, Architecture, Testing, Implementation sections; by-topic and by-audience navigation. (5) **Created DOCUMENTATION_CLEANUP_PLAN.md**: Complete inventory with remaining cleanup commands (12+ docs/spec-kit/ files pending archival). Total reduction: 250→~210 docs (-16%), target ~180-190 (-25-30%) when complete. Improves onboarding clarity, reduces maintenance burden.

tasks. It's common to concatenate three JSON objects separated by newlines or present them as an array. The instructions suggest returning the JSON as the final response. Here, it implies the system can manage storage automatically, so I’ll go with three separate JSON objects skillfully organized with blank lines in between. I’ll keep them valid and avoid adding extra commentary!\\\\n**Drafting research summary**\\\\n\\\\nI need to keep the research summary under 400 words and include several key items. First, I’ll outline the acceptance criteria based on the documentation, covering stage outputs, SQLite entries, and the cost summary. Next, I’ll include evidence requirements and relevant paths for documentation. I've noticed potential issues like stale telemetry from a costs summary, which currently shows a total of 0.0. Lastly, I’ll mention related files or tasks referring to evidence scripts when necessary.\\\\n**Clarifying research tasks**\\\\n\\\\nI want to reference the documentation and include the evidence stats script. It’s important to clarify several questions, like the mode (cheap-tier vs. premium), HAL MCP availability, and running in degraded mode. I’ll also confirm acceptance of using the SQLite consensus DB. I’ll cite memory IDs for each agent as I compose the three JSON outputs. The work breakdown will include confirming context, executing the plan with local-memory storage, and populating the acceptance mapping while keeping outputs relevant to the planning stage.\\\\n**Creating a work breakdown**\\\\n\\\\nThe work breakdown in the plan template focuses on architecture planning deliverables, including acceptance mapping, risks, telemetry checks, and guardrail checks. I’ll outline five steps: 1) Gather context from local memory and documentation, 2) Draft the plan structure according to the template, 3) Map acceptance criteria to validation artifacts, 4) Set up evidence and update the telemetry baseline, and 5) Write back consensus and implement a quality gate. I’ll also detail risks and assign ownership to relevant roles.\\\\n**Creating gpt_pro JSON**\\\\n\\\\nFor the gpt_pro JSON, I’ll include feasibility notes that reference an existing template and evidence. I will point out missing items, such as the absence of infra-ci memories, a cost summary showing 0 spending, no HAL MCP transcripts archived, and an unverified SQLite DB. The final plan will repeat the consensus steps, acceptance mapping, and risks. I'll ensure conflicts are noted as empty arrays while highlighting agreements with minor differences.

Problem Statement\\\\n\\\\n- SPEC-KIT-070 and future routing experiments require a neutral baseline SPEC to compare premium vs. cheap-model runs.\\\\n- Current validation often reuses the SPEC being modified, creating circular dependencies and biased prompts.\\\\n- We need a stable script that any engineer can run to gather cost/quality evidence without touching roadmap artefacts.\\\\n\\\\n### Goals\\\\n\\\\n1. Provide canonical prompts for `/speckit.plan`, `/speckit.tasks`, `/speckit.validate` that yield medium-complexity outputs.\\\\n2. Ensure each stage generates consensus artefacts, local-memory entries, and cost summaries by default.\\\\n3. Keep content generic enough that reviewers can sign off quickly, yet structured enough to exercise agent reasoning.\\\\n\\\\n### Non-Goals\\\\n\\\\n[2025-11-02T21:04:09] tokens used: 10,931\\\\n\\\\n[2025-11-02T21:04:18] thinking\\\\n\\\\n**Clarifying storage backend**\\\\n\\\\nI'm looking at consensus.rs, which mentions SQLite as the primary source. There's some ambiguity about the storage backend, whether it should be local-memory or SQLite. The PRD specifies local-memory, so I need to clarify that.\\\\n\\\\nNow, for the guardrail script path, it requires creating a new bash script. However, there's a conflict between using Rust native guardrails and the existing shell script. I really need a human to help sort this out! \\\\n\\\\nFinally, the cost per stage numbers are examples, but acceptance criteria rely on driving outputs of 4-6k tokens measured in logs. The consensus requirements are a bit loosely defined, which makes it tricky.\\\\n**Clarifying calculation methods**\\\\n\\\\nI need to clarify the exact method of calculation here.\\\\n\\\\nThe validation thresholds mention a latency of 200ms at 50 RPS local, but since this is just a documentation workload and not an actual microservice, those metrics aren't measurable. There’s some conflict here: the workload is synthetic, meaning we can't validate stage metrics for a microservice.

Capture: core doc presence (PRD/spec/plan/tasks), SPEC.md tracker state, latest guardrail baseline per stage (schema v1/v2), consensus verdict/conflict count, agent coverage (which models participated), and timestamps.\\n./docs/SPEC-KIT-035-spec-status-diagnostics/spec.md:10:3. **T47.3 – Evidence footprint sentinel.** Summarize combined evidence size (commands + consensus) with warning banners at ≥20 MB and critical alerts at ≥25 MB. Highlight the heaviest directories so operators know where to clean up—all computed in Rust.\\n./docs/SPEC-KIT-035-spec-status-diagnostics/spec.md:11:4. **T47.4 – TUI dashboard experience.** Wire `/spec-status <SPEC-ID>` through `slash_command.rs`, `chatwidget.rs`, and rendering helpers so the TUI shows a concise markdown summary (packet health, stage table, tracker note, evidence warnings, recent agent mix, stale indicators). The flow must be TUI-only—no Bash/CLI fallbacks.\\n./docs/SPEC-KIT-035-spec-status-diagnostics/spec.md:12:5. **T47.5 – Tests & fixtures.** Provide fixtures under `codex-rs/tui/tests/fixtures/spec_status/` covering healthy, stale, missing-consensus, missing-doc, and oversized-evidence scenarios. Add focused unit tests for telemetry parsing + freshness + footprint thresholds, and integration tests ensuring the rendered markdown includes expected cues.\\n./docs/SPEC-KIT-035-spec-status-diagnostics/spec.md:13:6. **T47.6 – Documentation updates.** Update `docs/slash-commands.md` and draft a concise operator note in `docs/spec-kit/spec-status-diagnostics.md` explaining how to interpret the TUI quick view and data sources. Record example screenshots in evidence once implementation lands.\\n./docs/SPEC-KIT-035-spec-status-diagnostics/spec.md:17:- All agents converged on a phased sequence: build the Rust telemetry aggregator, compute evidence footprints, surface the `/spec-status` dashboard, keep CLI fallback parity, invest in fixtures/tests, and close with documentation plus release validation. According to Byterover memory layer, evidence thresholds must remain warning-only while still surfaced prominently.\\n./docs/SPEC-KIT-035-spec-status-diagnostics/spec.md:22:- *Evidence detail*: Claude and Code insisted on explicit threshold tests (20 MB/25 MB) and remediation hints; Gemini captured alerts conceptually. The merged plan adopts the stricter sentinel checks.\\n./docs/SPEC-KIT-035-spec-status-diagnostics/spec.md:26:1. **Telemetry Aggregator & Staleness Guard** – Build `spec_status.rs` parsers (schema v1/v2), classify stage health, and enforce configurable freshness checks. Dependencies: telemetry schema docs, `scripts/spec_ops_004/common.sh`. Validation: `cargo test -p codex-tui spec_status::tests::parse_*`. Evidence: parser logs, fixture outputs.\\n./docs/SPEC-KIT-035-spec-status-diagnostics/spec.md:27:2. **Evidence Footprint Sentinel** – Compute combined evidence size, raise ⚠/❌ banners, and list top offenders without altering exit codes. Dependencies: filesystem metadata helpers, `/spec-evidence-stats`. Validation: `cargo test -p codex-tui spec_status::tests::footprint_thresholds`. Evidence: screenshots + oversized fixture manifest.\\n./docs/SPEC-KIT-035-spec-status-diagnostics/spec.md:28:3. **TUI Dashboard Rendering** – Wire `/spec-status` command, render packet health, stage table, blockers, agent mix, and footprint alerts with 80×24 fallback. Dependencies: Slash command plumbing, telemetry aggregator. Validation: `cargo test -p codex-tui spec_status_integration`; manual `/spec-status SPEC-KIT-DEMO`. Evidence: healthy/conflict/stale dashboards.\\n./docs/SPEC-KIT-035-spec-status-diagnostics/spec.md:29:4. **CLI Fallback JSON Parity** – Update `scripts/spec_ops_004/commands/spec_ops_status.sh` to emit schemaVersion 1.1 JSON, include degraded-mode messaging, and keep human-readable tables. Validation: `spec_ops_status.sh --spec SPEC-KIT-DEMO --format json | jq '.schemaVersion'`. Evidence: stored JSON sample.\\n./docs/SPEC-KIT-035-spec-status-diagnostics/spec.md:30:5. **HAL & Policy Messaging** – Display HAL/policy skipped vs failed states with remediation hints (`SPEC_OPS_TELEMETRY_HAL=1`, `/spec-ops-validate`). Validation: targeted unit tests + HAL-enabled manual run. Evidence: dashboard capture showing HAL failure vs skipped.\\n./docs/SPEC-KIT-035-spec-status-diagnostics/spec.md:31:6. **Fixture Library & Regression Coverage** – Populate fixtures for healthy, stale, missing-consensus, missing-doc, oversized-evidence scenarios; add unit + integration tests. Validation: `cargo test -p codex-tui spec_status_integration -- --nocapture`. Evidence: fixture manifest, test logs.\\n./docs/SPEC-KIT-035-spec-status-diagnostics/spec.md:32:7. **Documentation & Operator Playbook** – Update slash-command docs, add operator guide, embed screenshots, and document footprint cleanup workflow. Validation: `scripts/doc-structure-validate.sh --mode=templates`; `python3 scripts/spec-kit/lint_tasks.py`. Evidence: doc lint logs, published screenshots.\\n./docs/SPEC-KIT-035-spec-status-diagnostics/spec.md:33:8. **Release Validation & Evidence Ledger** – Run fmt/clippy/test suite, `/spec-status` demos, CLI JSON checks, footprint audit, and capture outputs under `docs/SPEC-OPS-004-integrated-coder-hooks/evidence/commands/SPEC-KIT-035/`; update SPEC.md with dated evidence.\\n./docs/SPEC-KIT-035-spec-status-diagnostics/spec.md:37:- Evidence scanning must remain performant on large trees—monitor runtime and consider caching if dashboard latency exceeds 2 s.\\n./docs/SPEC-KIT-035-spec-status-diagnostics/spec.md:38:- Evaluate whether evidence thresholds should become configurable per SPEC before release validation (raised by Code agent).\\n./docs/SPEC-KIT-035-spec-status-diagnostics/spec.md:43:- Evidence footprint sentinel raises warnings at ≥20 MB and critical alerts at ≥25 MB but does not change exit codes.\\n./docs/SPEC-KIT-035-spec-status-diagnostics/spec.md:47:| Requirement (PRD) | Validation Step | Test / Evidence |\\n./docs/SPEC-KIT-035-spec-status-diagnostics/spec.md:52:| R4: Evidence footprint warnings appear at ≥20 MB (⚠) and ≥25 MB (❌) | Oversized fixture measured via `spec_status_integration.rs`; TUI renders warning banner listing largest directories | Integration test log + screenshot |\\n./docs/SPEC-KIT-035-spec-status-diagnostics/spec.md:54:| R6: Documentation updated for operators | `docs/slash-commands.md` + `docs/spec-kit/spec-status-diagnostics.md` diffs reviewed; doc lint run | Doc lint log + diff |\\n./docs/SPEC-KIT-035-spec-status-diagnostics/spec.md:59:- **Evidence scanning latency:** Walking large evidence trees may impact responsiveness—optimize for latest artifact discovery and memoize where viable.\\n./docs/SPEC-KIT-035-spec-status-diagnostics/spec.md:63:- **Agreement:** Agents aligned on a TUI-first snapshot that reuses existing guardrail and consensus telemetry, highlights stage freshness, and surfaces evidence footprint warnings without shell dependencies or HAL data.\\n./docs/SPEC-KIT-035-spec-status-diagnostics/spec.md:65:  - Claude advocated for deeper evidence drilldowns; consensus kept a lightweight warning banner with top offenders listed.\\n./docs/SPEC-KIT-035-spec-status-diagnostics/spec.md:70:- `/spec-status SPEC-ID` renders the quick-view TUI dashboard with packet health, stage cues, evidence footprint warnings, agent coverage, and stale indicators.\\n./docs/SPEC-KIT-035-spec-status-diagnostics/spec.md:72:- Example screenshots and logs stored under SPEC-KIT-035 evidence; SPEC.md tracker updated when implementation completes.\\n./docs/SPEC-KIT-070-model-cost-optimization/PHASE1_COMPLETE.md:185:   - Integration ready for evidence pipeline\\n./docs/SPEC-KIT-070-model-cost-optimization/PHASE1_COMPLETE.md:311:- [ ] Write cost summaries to evidence/\\n./docs/SPEC-KIT-070-model-cost-optimization/PHASE1_COMPLETE.md:333:- [ ] Update SPEC.md with progress\\n./docs/SPEC-KIT-070-model-cost-optimization/PHASE1_COMPLETE.md:411:- [ ] Evidence artifacts remain comprehensive\\n./docs/SPEC-KIT-071-memory-system-optimization/ULTRATHINK_RESEARCH_SYNTHESIS.md:514:    tools: [\\\"mcp\\\", \\\"testing\\\", \\\"consensus\\\", \\\"evidence\\\"]\\n./docs/SPEC-KIT-071-memory-system-optimization/ULTRATHINK_RESEARCH_SYNTHESIS.md:637:- ❌ Progress updates (use SPEC.md)\\n./codex-rs/tui/src/chatwidget/spec_kit/state.rs:34:        native_agent_ids: Option<Vec<String>>, // SPEC-KIT-900: Track native orchestrator agent IDs\\n./codex-rs/tui/src/chatwidget/spec_kit/state.rs:864:/// Validate that guardrail evidence artifacts exist on disk\\n./codex-rs/tui/src/chatwidget/spec_kit/state.rs:865:pub fn validate_guardrail_evidence(\\n./codex-rs/tui/src/chatwidget/spec_kit/state.rs:875:        return (vec![\\\"No evidence artifacts recorded\\\".to_string()], 0);\\n./codex-rs/tui/src/chatwidget/spec_kit/state.rs:918:        failures.push(\\\"No evidence artifacts found on disk\\\".to_string());\\n./docs/SPEC-KIT-035-spec-status-diagnostics/tasks.md:3:- Spec: docs/SPEC-KIT-035-spec-status-diagnostics/spec.md (2025-10-08 synthesis)\\n./docs/SPEC-KIT-035-spec-status-diagnostics/tasks.md:4:- Plan: docs/SPEC-KIT-035-spec-status-diagnostics/plan.md (2025-10-08 refresh)\\n./docs/SPEC-KIT-035-spec-status-diagnostics/tasks.md:11:- **Dependencies**: `docs/spec-kit/telemetry-schema-v2.md`, `scripts/spec_ops_004/common.sh`, evidence roots under `docs/SPEC-OPS-004-integrated-coder-hooks/evidence/commands/<SPEC-ID>/`.\\n./docs/SPEC-KIT-035-spec-status-diagnostics/tasks.md:13:- **Evidence**: Parser logs, fixture outputs (healthy vs stale), local-memory note covering schema handling.\\n./docs/SPEC-KIT-035-spec-status-diagnostics/tasks.md:14:- **Docs**: Add architecture note to `docs/spec-kit/spec-status-diagnostics.md` explaining data sources and freshness rule.\\n./docs/SPEC-KIT-035-spec-status-diagnostics/tasks.md:16:### 2.

This produces noisy telemetry, wastes credits, and leaves evidence folders with duplicated artifacts. The fix must make validate stage scheduling single-flight, align retries with AR-2 policy, and ensure local-memory artifacts remain canonical. Relevant orchestration resides in `codex-rs/tui/src/chatwidget/spec_kit/handler.rs` (auto submission and completion handlers), `state.rs` (`validate_retries`, `SpecAutoPhase`), `quality_gate_handler.rs` (multi-agent fan-out patterns), and `routing.rs` (subagent command formatting).\\n./docs/SPEC-KIT-069-address-speckit-validate-multiple-agent-calls-and-incorrect-spawning/spec.md:16:**Story**: As a maintainer invoking `/speckit.validate SPEC-KIT-###`, I want exactly one trio of validation agents to execute so the evidence and telemetry reflect a single run.\\n./docs/SPEC-KIT-069-address-speckit-validate-multiple-agent-calls-and-incorrect-spawning/spec.md:41:**Story**: As an operator, if I fire a manual `/speckit.validate` while an automated run is

retrying…\n[2025-11-03T02:50:38] codex\nMemento — SPEC-KIT-900 (/spec-tasks)\n\nWhat’s finished\n- Queried local-memory MCP for SPEC-KIT-900 context:\n  - spec-tracker: 13ae32ae-5d69-480e-bf6c-953b615fe437 (gpt_pro spec-plan consensus + feasibility/final_plan summary)\n  - docs-ops: f2c298e3-d6d5-4c0d-9660-01ecdbfc9638 (claude spec-plan work_breakdown incl. HAL/evidence indexing)\n  - impl-notes: c1f7a95f-66c5-4d56-9a33-9fee7d5e590f (claude notes: guardrail swap → native, JSON extraction stabilization)\n  - infra-ci: none found\n- Scanned repo for anchors:\n  - SPEC-KIT-900-COMPREHENSIVE-SOLUTION.md (multiple instructions referencing plan/evidence paths)\n  - docs/SPEC-OPS-004-integrated-coder-hooks/evidence/... (DEMO artifacts show expected evidence structure)\n  - codex-rs/spec-kit/types.rs (HalMode enum indicates HAL optionality), and presence of codex-mcp-client in workspace\n\nWhat still needs work\n- Generate all three /spec-tasks JSON outputs (Gemini research, Claude synthesis, GPT-5 arbiter) per 20251002-tasks-a and return them. System will handle storage to local-memory.\n- If HAL HTTP MCP profile is configured, run health/REST/GraphQL templates via codex-mcp-client → hal-mcp and archive outputs under evidence/commands/SPEC-KIT-900/. If not configured or network-restricted, explicitly mark HAL as skipped with rationale in the artifacts.\n- Update SPEC docs/tasks surfaces and acceptance coverage mapping, referencing SPEC.md and docs paths.\n\nRecent update_plan call\n- None in this session (no update_plan was executed). Nothing to repeat verbatim.\n\nOutstanding TODOs (paths and anchors)\n- Produce agent outputs (this stage)\n  - No file edits required; just emit three JSON payloads as final responses:\n    - Gemini research JSON: cite memory IDs [13ae32ae..., f2c298e3..., c1f7a95f...] and/or HAL transcript IDs if present.\n    - Claude synthesis JSON: ensure acceptance mapping includes lint + tests.\n    - GPT-5 arbiter JSON: validate guardrails (branch clean, lint/test hooks), reference SPEC.md update steps and docs paths.\n- Evidence/Docs\n  - docs/SPEC-OPS-004-integrated-coder-hooks/evidence/ (pre-create SPEC-KIT-900 subfolders if needed): consensus/ and commands/ (see DEMO fixture paths in: docs/SPEC-OPS-004-integrated-coder-hooks/evidence/consensus/SPEC-KIT-DEMO/*)\n  - Consider adding/update: docs/SPEC-KIT-900-generic-smoke/tasks.md (SPEC-KIT-900-COMPREHENSIVE-SOLUTION.md references plan.md; mirror for tasks)\n- HAL HTTP MCP (optional)\n  - codex-rs/spec-kit/src/types.rs: HalMode enum (lines ~138-152) — ensure mode reflects “skipped” if no profile; otherwise run and archive.\n  - Run command (if configured): cargo run -p codex-mcp-client --bin call_tool -- --tool local-memory -- npx -y hal-mcp (store transcripts under evidence/commands/SPEC-KIT-900/hal_*)\n- Consensus and storage tags (no code change; just ensure in outputs)\n  - Tags: spec:SPEC-KIT-900, stage:spec-tasks, domains: [spec-tracker, docs-ops, impl-notes, infra-ci]\n  - Importance: ≥ 8 per MEMORY-POLICY.md\n- Cross-check prompt sources\n  - docs/spec-kit/prompts.json (ensure version matches 20251002-tasks-a if referenced by tooling; repo shows parser hooks in TUI.md at lines ~436, ~455)\n\nCode needing more tests\n- JSON extraction and routing for agent artifacts\n  - Area: TUI/Spec-Kit artifact parsing and storage (likely Rust-side now; previous Python brace-count fragility noted)\n  - Tests: invalid/partial JSON, multiple JSON blocks, large payloads, unicode, and degraded agent participation (2/3)\n- HAL integration toggles\n  - Tests: hal passed, hal skipped (no profile), hal failed (network/timeout) — ensure telemetry and evidence entries reflect state\n- Evidence path correctness\n  - Tests: pre-created directories vs on-demand creation; file locking (fs2) under concurrent stages; oversized evidence handling\n- Retry and race handling\n  - Files:\n    - codex-rs/tui/src/chatwidget/spec_kit/handler.rs: run_consensus_with_retry(), agent execution retries (anchors mentioned in docs)\n    - codex-rs/tui/src/chatwidget/spec_kit/consensus.rs: remember_consensus_verdict(), fetch_memory_entries()\n  - Tests: “MCP manager not initialized yet” race, empty-results retry paths, degraded consensus acceptance\n\nOpen bugs, quirks, setup notes\n- Branch state shows “unknown” in this workspace; guardrail checks about clean branch may fail. Ensure a clean git state or disable shell guardrail if using native checks.\n- Network access is restricted here; HAL via npx hal-mcp likely unavailable. Mark HAL as skipped with rationale in evidence and arbiter JSON.\n- Evidence directory naming must match telemetry expectations precisely; pre-create consensus/ and commands/ under SPEC-KIT-900 to avoid drop-offs.\n- Local-memory MCP is the only allowed memory system (importance ≥8, namespaced tags). Do not use deprecated MCP servers.\n- Known race: “MCP manager not initialized yet” — handled by retry logic (100→200→400ms). If hit, just rerun or let pipeline retry.\n- Evidence size soft limit: 25MB per SPEC (monitor if HAL outputs are large).\n\nReference anchors\n- SPEC-KIT-900-COMPREHENSIVE-SOLUTION.md (repo root) — contains SPEC-KIT-900 guidance and evidence path examples.\n- TUI.md lines ~178 (evidence glob), ~436 (prompts.json parser), ~455 (docs/spec-kit/), ~687+ (evidence/telemetry checks).\n- codex-rs/spec-kit/src/types.rs lines ~138-152 (HalMode enum).\n- Consensus fixture for structure reference: codex-rs/tui/tests/fixtures/consensus/demo-plan-gpt_pro.json (lines ~25-80 reference HAL optionality and evidence paths).\n\nNext agent: exact deliverables to unblock\n1) Emit Gemini research JSON (stage: spec-tasks, version 20251002-tasks-a) with surfaces/dependencies/spec_status, citing memory IDs: 13ae32ae..., f2c298e3..., c1f7a95f....\n2) Emit Claude synthesis JSON with tasks[], acceptance_coverage[], followups[] — include lint + test steps explicitly and acceptance mapping.\n3) Emit GPT-5 arbiter JSON with validated_tasks[], command_plan[] (include SPEC.md/docs path updates), consensus.agreements/conflicts. Note HAL status (skipped here, unless profile exists).\n4) If HAL profile is actually configured in your environment, run the HAL HTTP MCP templates and archive outputs; otherwise store a “hal: { status: 'skipped', reason: 'no profile / network-restricted' }” in telemetry/evidence notes.\n\nTags to use when storing (system may add automatically)\n- spec:SPEC-KIT-900, stage:spec-tasks, type:consensus-artifact, project:codex-rs, component:spec-kit, domain:[spec-tracker|docs-ops|impl-notes|infra-ci]\n- importance: 8+\n[2025-11-03T02:50:41] ERROR: stream error: stream disconnected before completion: Your input exceeds the context window of this model.

Evidence will be gathered by monitoring audit logs (`tail -f ~/.code/log/codex-tui.log | grep \"AUDIT:\"`), verifying SQLite entries (`sqlite3 ~/.code/consensus_artifacts.db`), and checking for the presence and content of `plan.md`."
