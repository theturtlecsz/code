## Sandbox & approvals

### Approval modes

We've chosen a powerful default for how Planner works on your computer: `Auto`. In this approval mode, Planner can read files, make edits, and run commands in the working directory automatically. However, Planner will need your approval to work outside the working directory or access network.

When you just want to chat, or if you want to plan before diving in, you can switch to `Read Only` mode with the `/approvals` command.

If you need Planner to read files, make edits, and run commands with network access, without approval, you can use `Full Access`. Exercise caution before doing so.

#### Defaults and recommendations

- Planner runs in a sandbox by default with strong guardrails: it prevents editing files outside the workspace and blocks network access unless enabled.
- On launch, Planner detects whether the folder is version-controlled and recommends:
  - Version-controlled folders: `Auto` (workspace write + on-request approvals)
  - Non-version-controlled folders: `Read Only`
- The workspace includes the current directory and temporary directories like `/tmp`. Use the `/status` command to see which directories are in the workspace.
- You can set these explicitly:
  - `code --sandbox workspace-write --ask-for-approval on-request`
  - `code --sandbox read-only --ask-for-approval on-request`

### Can I run without ANY approvals?

Yes, you can disable all approval prompts with `--ask-for-approval never`. This option works with all `--sandbox` modes, so you still have full control over Planner's level of autonomy. It will make its best attempt with whatever constraints you provide.

### Common sandbox + approvals combinations

| Intent                                  | Flags                                                                                  | Effect                                                                                  |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Safe read-only browsing                 | `--sandbox read-only --ask-for-approval on-request`                                            | Planner can read files and answer questions. Planner requires approval to make edits, run commands, or access network. |
| Read-only non-interactive (CI)          | `--sandbox read-only --ask-for-approval never`                                                 | Reads only; never escalates                                                                     |
| Let it edit the repo, ask if risky      | `--sandbox workspace-write --ask-for-approval on-request`                                      | Planner can read files, make edits, and run commands in the workspace. Planner requires approval for actions outside the workspace or for network access. |
| Auto (preset)                           | `--full-auto` (equivalent to `--sandbox workspace-write` + `--ask-for-approval on-failure`)     | Planner can read files, make edits, and run commands in the workspace. Planner requires approval when a sandboxed command fails or needs escalation. |
| YOLO (not recommended)                  | `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox` (alias: `--yolo`)                                 | No sandbox; no prompts                                                                          |

> Note: In `workspace-write`, network is disabled by default unless enabled in config (`[sandbox_workspace_write].network_access = true`).

#### Fine-tuning in `config.toml`

```toml
# approval mode
approval_policy = "untrusted"
sandbox_mode    = "read-only"

# full-auto mode
approval_policy = "on-request"
sandbox_mode    = "workspace-write"

# Optional: allow network in workspace-write mode
[sandbox_workspace_write]
network_access = true
```

You can also save presets as **profiles**:

```toml
[profiles.full_auto]
approval_policy = "on-request"
sandbox_mode    = "workspace-write"

[profiles.readonly_quiet]
approval_policy = "never"
sandbox_mode    = "read-only"
```

### Experimenting with the sandbox

To test what happens when a command is run under the sandbox, use the debug subcommands:

```
# macOS
code debug seatbelt [--full-auto] [COMMAND]...

# Linux
code debug landlock [--full-auto] [COMMAND]...
```

### Platform sandboxing details

The mechanism used to implement the sandbox policy depends on your OS:

- **macOS 12+** uses **Apple Seatbelt** and runs commands using `sandbox-exec` with a profile (`-p`) that corresponds to the `--sandbox` that was specified.
- **Linux** uses a combination of Landlock/seccomp APIs to enforce the `sandbox` configuration.

Note that when running Linux in a containerized environment such as Docker, sandboxing may not work if the host/container configuration does not support the necessary Landlock/seccomp APIs. In such cases, configure your container so it provides the sandbox guarantees you need and then run `code` with `--sandbox danger-full-access` (or `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`) within your container.
