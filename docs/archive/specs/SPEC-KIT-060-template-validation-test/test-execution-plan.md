# Template Validation Test Execution Plan

## Objective
Systematically validate whether templates improve spec quality vs free-form generation.

## Test Sequence

### Part 1: Baseline (Non-Template)

**Temporarily disable templates in config:**
```bash
# Edit ~/.code/config.toml
# Comment out template loading in /new-spec
# Agents generate PRD/spec from scratch
```

**Execute:**
```bash
/new-spec Add webhook notification system for task completion events
# Wait for completion
# Record time, check output
```

**Execute:**
```bash
/new-spec Implement search autocomplete with fuzzy matching
# Wait for completion
# Record time, check output
```

**Capture metrics for both:**
- Execution time (start to "Run /speckit.auto..." message)
- Sections present (grep "^##" count)
- Has user scenarios? (grep "User Scenario\|Story:")
- Has edge cases? (grep "Edge Case")
- Has P1/P2/P3? (grep "P1:\|P2:\|P3:")
- Unfilled placeholders? (grep "\[.*\]" count)

**Save outputs:**
- docs/SPEC-KIT-061-test-feature-a/ → Baseline A
- docs/SPEC-KIT-062-test-feature-b/ → Baseline B

---

### Part 2: Template-Based

**Re-enable templates:**
```bash
# Edit ~/.code/config.toml
# Uncomment template loading (current state)
```

**Execute:**
```bash
/new-spec Add webhook notification system for task completion events
# Same description as SPEC-061
# Wait for completion
# Record metrics
```

**Execute:**
```bash
/new-spec Implement search autocomplete with fuzzy matching
# Same description as SPEC-062
# Wait for completion
# Record metrics
```

**Save outputs:**
- docs/SPEC-KIT-063-test-feature-c/ → Template A
- docs/SPEC-KIT-064-test-feature-d/ → Template B

---

### Part 3: Analysis

**Compare Baseline vs Template:**

```bash
# Structure comparison
diff <(grep "^##" docs/SPEC-KIT-061*/spec.md | cut -d: -f2) \
     <(grep "^##" docs/SPEC-KIT-063*/spec.md | cut -d: -f2)

# Should show: Template has consistent sections

# Completeness check
for SPEC in 061 062 063 064; do
  echo "=== SPEC-KIT-${SPEC} ==="
  echo "Sections: $(grep -c "^##" docs/SPEC-KIT-${SPEC}*/spec.md)"
  echo "User scenarios: $(grep -c "User Scenario\|Story:" docs/SPEC-KIT-${SPEC}*/spec.md)"
  echo "Edge cases: $(grep -c "Edge Case" docs/SPEC-KIT-${SPEC}*/spec.md)"
  echo "Priorities: $(grep -c "P1:\|P2:\|P3:" docs/SPEC-KIT-${SPEC}*/spec.md)"
done
```

**Generate comparison report:**
```bash
cat > docs/SPEC-KIT-060-template-validation-test/comparison-report.md <<EOF
# Template Validation Results

## Baseline (Non-Template)
- SPEC-061: [METRICS]
- SPEC-062: [METRICS]
- Average time: [TIME]
- Sections: [COUNT]
- Completeness: [SCORE]

## Template-Based
- SPEC-063: [METRICS]
- SPEC-064: [METRICS]
- Average time: [TIME]
- Sections: [COUNT]
- Completeness: [SCORE]

## Verdict
[PASS/FAIL based on success criteria]

## Recommendation
[PROCEED/ABORT template migration]
EOF
```

---

## Success Thresholds

**PASS (continue to Phase 2):**
- Template specs have ≥20% more sections
- 100% template consistency (063 structure == 064 structure)
- Time ≤ baseline +10%
- All templates have user scenarios + edge cases

**FAIL (abort templates):**
- Template specs missing sections baseline had
- Structure still varies between runs
- Time >20% slower
- Agents skip placeholders (leave unfilled)

---

## Execution Timeline

- **Part 1 (Baseline)**: 20 minutes (2 × 10 min)
- **Part 2 (Template)**: 20 minutes (2 × 10 min)
- **Part 3 (Analysis)**: 15 minutes
- **Total**: ~55 minutes

---

## Decision Gate

**After analysis:**

**IF PASS:**
```bash
git add docs/SPEC-KIT-060*/comparison-report.md
git commit -m "test(templates): validation passed, proceeding to Phase 2"
# Proceed to implement /clarify, /analyze, /checklist
```

**IF FAIL:**
```bash
git add docs/SPEC-KIT-060*/comparison-report.md
git commit -m "test(templates): validation failed, reverting"
# Revert /new-spec to non-template
# Document learnings
# Abandon template approach
```

**No guessing. Measure, compare, decide based on data.**
