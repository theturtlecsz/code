# Unlock Review: SPEC-KIT-DEMO Guardrail Baseline (T26)

## Branch & Lock Context
- Branch: `spec-auto-telemetry` (clean working tree, 13 commits ahead of origin).
- SPEC.md row T26 remains **In Progress** with telemetry references for plan/tasks/implement/validate.
- Guardrail unlock telemetry captured at `docs/SPEC-OPS-004-integrated-coder-hooks/evidence/commands/SPEC-KIT-DEMO/spec-unlock_2025-10-12T16:43:43Z-1194715370.json` (status `unlock_status":"unlocked"`, policy prefilter/final passed).

## Outstanding Work
1. **HAL MCP validation** — blocked on `HAL_SECRET_KAVEDARR_API_KEY`; rerun required once credentials land (or document permanent skip).
2. **Halt gating screenshot** — assign owner, capture PNG, reference path in docs/tasks/SPEC.md notes.
3. **Consensus bundle refresh** — generate 2025-10-12 per-agent JSON + synthesis via `/spec-plan --consensus-exec` (current artifacts from 2025-10-05 remain baseline only).
4. **Docs refresh** — update docs/SPEC-KIT-DEMO/{plan.md,tasks.md} and SPEC.md notes with final telemetry filenames, HAL outcome, lint & screenshot evidence.

## Risks & Safeguards
- Degraded model lineup (Gemini/Claude/Codex only); `gpt_pro`/`gpt_codex` unavailable — record in telemetry and monitor cost impact.
- HAL skip recorded via `SPEC_OPS_HAL_SKIP=1`; ensure rerun tracked so skip does not become permanent debt.
- Evidence footprint within guardrail budget (22 MB command, 204 KB consensus; 29 JSON artifacts) — continue monitoring with `scripts/spec_ops_004/evidence_stats.sh`.
- Keeping branch locked avoids premature merge while outstanding acceptance criteria remain open.

## Recommendation
- **Hold unlock** until HAL validation, lint, screenshot, and consensus refresh are complete.
- Maintain SPEC.md T26 status `In Progress`; update notes with follow-up progress.
- Re-run `/guardrail.unlock SPEC-KIT-DEMO` after outstanding items close to record final telemetry bundle and revise this memo.
