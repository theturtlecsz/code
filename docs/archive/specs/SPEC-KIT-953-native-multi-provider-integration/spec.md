# SPEC-KIT-953 — Native Multi-Provider Integration (Deprecated)

**Status**: Deprecated / Closed (Won’t Do)

This directory exists to preserve the historical record referenced by `SPEC.md`.

## Why It’s Deprecated

Planner uses provider CLIs (e.g. `claude`, `gemini`) for auth and execution rather than implementing native OAuth/API-key flows.
