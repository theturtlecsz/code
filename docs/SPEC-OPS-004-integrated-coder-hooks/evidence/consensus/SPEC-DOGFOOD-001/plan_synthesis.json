Key constraints include the TUI (`~/code`) being ready for dogfooding, a healthy local-memory daemon, an authenticated NotebookLM service with 5 core documentation sources, and an existing `~/.config/codex/stage0.toml` configured for Tier2 with a specific NotebookLM ID (`4e80974f-789d-43bd-abe9-7b1e76839506`). Validation involves running `code doctor` to ensure all checks pass, executing `/speckit.auto SPEC-DOGFOOD-001`, and verifying Stage0 logs for `tier2_used=true` indicators. Prerequisites like 'no surprise fan-out' (P0.1), 'GR-001 compliance' (P0.2), 'single-shot dispatch' (P0.3), and 'constitution gate satisfied' (P0.4) are critical for a predictable and policy-compliant workflow.\"\n}\n- {\n  \"topic\": \"Related Files/Modules/Tests\",\n  \"details\": \"The core components involved are the Code TUI (`~/code`), the local-memory daemon, and the NotebookLM service. The configuration is managed by `~/.config/codex/stage0.toml`. Verification involves the `code doctor` command for health checks, the `/speckit.auto SPEC-DOGFOOD-001` command for execution, and `lm search` for querying local-memory. Expected artifacts, `TASK_BRIEF.md` and `DIVINE_TRUTH.md`, should be found in `docs/SPEC-DOGFOOD-001/evidence/`.\"\n}\n- {\n  \"topic\": \"Potential Risks or Unknowns\",\n  \"details\": \"Identified risks include NotebookLM rate limiting (mitigated by Tier2 failing closed), memory pressure on the service (mitigated by monitoring and auto-recovery), and the Stage0 engine not being correctly wired (requiring log verification). Unknowns include the specific content/format expectations for 'Divine Truth' beyond its existence as an `.md` file, the precise method for viewing Stage0 logs to confirm `tier2_used=true`, and the exact format of the GR-001 error message for multi-agent rejection. Non-goals explicitly exclude validating downstream pipeline stages, performance, cache optimization, or code changes to the Stage0 engine.\"\n}\n\n**questions**:\n- \"What specific content and format are expected for 'Divine Truth' within the `DIVINE_TRUTH.md` artifact?\"\n- \"What is the recommended method or command to effectively view Stage0 logs and confirm the `tier2_used=true` indicator?\"\n- \"How should the GR-001 error message be verified for acceptance criteria A5? Is there a specific output format or string to look for when quality gates with >1 agent are rejected?\"\n\n\n## Consensus Summary\n\n- Synthesized from 1 agent responses\n- All agents completed successfully\n",
