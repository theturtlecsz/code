Key requirements include: confirming NotebookLM is queried and contributes to 'Divine Truth' synthesis, ensuring `TASK_BRIEF.md` and `DIVINE_TRUTH.md` artifacts are generated in the spec evidence directory (e.g., `docs/SPEC-DOGFOOD-001/evidence/`), and validating a system pointer memory with the `system:true` tag is stored in local-memory. The end-to-end flow should be demonstrated by successfully running `/speckit.auto SPEC-DOGFOOD-001`. Prerequisites demand no surprise fan-out (only canonical agents), GR-001 compliance (no multi-agent debate), single-shot dispatch, and a satisfied constitution gate (DB bootstrap complete).\"\n}\n- {\n  \"topic\": \"Related Files/Modules/Tests\",\n  \"details\": \"Relevant components include the `local-memory daemon`, `NotebookLM service`, and the Stage0 configuration file (`~/.config/codex/stage0.toml`). The `code doctor` command is used for health checks. The primary execution command is `/speckit.auto SPEC-DOGFOOD-001`. Verification involves checking the contents of the `docs/SPEC-DOGFOOD-001/evidence/` directory for `TASK_BRIEF.md` and `DIVINE_TRUTH.md`, and using `lm search` to query local-memory for system pointers.\"\n}\n- {\n  \"topic\": \"Potential Risks or Unknowns\",\n  \"details\": \"Potential risks identified are NotebookLM rate limiting, which is mitigated by Tier2 failing closed and Tier1 continuing; memory pressure on the service, mitigated by monitoring health endpoints and service auto-recovery; and the Stage0 engine not being properly wired, which requires verification via logs and escalation if Stage0 is skipped entirely. The specifics of 'Divine Truth synthesis' contribution beyond file generation are unclear, as is the exact verification process for the 'constitution gate satisfied: DB bootstrap complete' using `code doctor`.\"\n}\n\n**questions**:\n- \"What specific log output or indicators confirm that NotebookLM actively contributed to the 'Divine Truth synthesis' process, rather than just being queried?\"\n- \"What is the expected output or diagnostic message from `code doctor` that definitively indicates 'constitution gate satisfied: DB bootstrap complete'?\"\n- \"What are the precise log patterns or messages that signify `tier2_used=true` or that the 'Stage0 engine is wired' correctly within the output of `/speckit.auto`?\"\n- \"What is the expected content and structure of the local-memory entry tagged with `system:true` for `SPEC-DOGFOOD-001`?\"\n\n\n## Consensus Summary\n\n- Synthesized from 1 agent responses\n- All agents completed successfully\n",
