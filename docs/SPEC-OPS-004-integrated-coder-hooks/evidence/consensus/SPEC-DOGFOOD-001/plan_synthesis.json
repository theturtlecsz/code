Key constraints include: NotebookLM contributing to Divine Truth synthesis, generation of `TASK_BRIEF.md` and `DIVINE_TRUTH.md` in `docs/SPEC-DOGFOOD-001/evidence/`, and storage of a `system:true` tagged memory in local-memory. Prerequisites (P0) like no surprise fan-out, GR-001 compliance, and single-shot dispatch must be met, verified via `code doctor`. Configuration is set in `~/.config/codex/stage0.toml`, enabling Tier2 and pointing to NotebookLM notebook `code-project-docs` (ID: `4e80974f-789d-43bd-abe9-7b1e76839506`).\"\n}\n- {\n  \"topic\": \"Related Files/Modules/Tests\",\n  \"details\": \"Relevant files/paths include `~/.config/codex/stage0.toml` for configuration, `docs/SPEC-DOGFOOD-001/evidence/` as the output directory for artifacts (`TASK_BRIEF.md`, `DIVINE_TRUTH.md`). Key commands for verification are `code doctor` for health checks, `/speckit.auto SPEC-DOGFOOD-001` for execution, and `lm search` for querying local-memory. The TUI (`~/code`) is the operational environment.\"\n}\n- {\n  \"topic\": \"Potential Risks or Unknowns\",\n  \"details\": \"Potential risks involve NotebookLM rate limiting (Tier2 fails closed, Tier1 continues), memory pressure on the service (monitor via health endpoint, service auto-recovers), and Stage0 engine not being properly wired (verify via logs, escalate if skipped). There's an implicit unknown around programmatic verification of the quality of synthesized content.\"\n}\n\n**questions**:\n- \"What are the specific log messages or indicators (beyond `tier2_used=true`) that confirm NotebookLM's actual contribution to Divine Truth synthesis?\"\n- \"How can we programmatically verify the content of `TASK_BRIEF.md` and `DIVINE_TRUTH.md` to ensure they contain 'synthesized context from project docs' as specified in success metrics, rather than just checking for their existence?\"\n- \"What is the expected detailed structure or minimum content of the 'system pointer memory' to be stored in local-memory, apart from having the `system:true` tag?\"\n\n\n## Consensus Summary\n\n- Synthesized from 1 agent responses\n- All agents completed successfully\n",
