This involves confirming NotebookLM is queried for 'Divine Truth' synthesis, 'TASK_BRIEF.md' and 'DIVINE_TRUTH.md' artifacts are generated in the spec evidence directory (docs/SPEC-DOGFOOD-001/evidence/), and a system pointer memory with 'system:true' tag is stored in local-memory. The end-to-end flow must complete successfully. Constraints include adherence to P0 prerequisites: no unexpected agent fan-out, GR-001 compliance (no multi-agent consensus), single-shot slash command dispatch, and verification of DB bootstrap completion (P0.4).\"\n}\n- {\n  \"topic\": \"Related Files/Modules/Tests\",\n  \"details\": \"The workload directly interacts with the TUI via '/speckit.auto'. Key files and commands involved are: '~/.config/codex/stage0.toml' for configuration, the 'code doctor' command for initial health checks, the 'lm search' command for querying local-memory, and the expected output directory 'docs/SPEC-DOGFOOD-001/evidence/' for generated artifacts.\"\n}\n- {\n  \"topic\": \"Potential Risks or Unknowns\",\n  \"details\": \"Identified risks include NotebookLM rate limiting, which is mitigated by Tier2 failing closed and Tier1 continuing. Memory pressure on the NotebookLM service is a risk to be monitored via its health endpoint, with an expectation of service auto-recovery. A potential unknown is the Stage0 engine not being correctly wired, which would require verification via logs and escalation if Stage0 is entirely skipped. The status of 'Constitution gate satisfied: DB bootstrap complete' (P0.4) is explicitly marked as '⏳ Verify with code doctor', indicating a pending verification point.\"\n}\n\n**questions**:\n- \"What specific output or status from 'code doctor' confirms that the 'Constitution gate satisfied: DB bootstrap complete' prerequisite (P0.4) is met?\"\n- \"Where are the Stage0 logs located, and what is the exact log indicator (e.g., specific string, log level, file path) for 'tier2_used=true' or a similar successful Tier2 integration?\"\n- \"Beyond mere existence, is there a specific content or structural validation required for 'TASK_BRIEF.md' and 'DIVINE_TRUTH.md' (e.g., minimum size, presence of key phrases, format adherence)?\"\n- \"What is the exact health endpoint for the NotebookLM service, and what specific metrics or indicators should be monitored to assess 'Memory pressure on service'?\"\n\n\n## Consensus Summary\n\n- Synthesized from 1 agent responses\n- All agents completed successfully\n",
