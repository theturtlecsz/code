This includes confirming NotebookLM is queried and contributes to Divine Truth synthesis, ensuring `TASK_BRIEF.md` and `DIVINE_TRUTH.md` are generated in `docs/SPEC-DOGFOOD-001/evidence/`, and verifying a system pointer memory with `system:true` tag is stored in local-memory. Prerequisites include: no surprise fan-out (quality gates OFF by default), GR-001 compliance (no multi-agent debate), single-shot dispatch, and a satisfied Constitution gate (verified by `code doctor`). The `stage0.toml` configuration at `~/.config/codex/stage0.toml` must exist with Tier2 enabled.\"\n}\n- {\n  \"topic\": \"Related Files/Modules/Tests\",\n  \"details\": \"The relevant configuration file is `~/.config/codex/stage0.toml`. Testing involves running `code doctor` for health checks, executing `/speckit.auto SPEC-DOGFOOD-001`, examining Stage0 logs, and querying local-memory using `lm search` for the system pointer. Evidence artifacts are expected in `docs/SPEC-DOGFOOD-001/evidence/`.\"\n}\n- {\n  \"topic\": \"Potential Risks or Unknowns\",\n  \"details\": \"Potential risks include NotebookLM rate limiting (mitigated by Tier2 failing closed and Tier1 continuing), memory pressure on the service (monitored via health endpoint, service auto-recovers), and Stage0 engine not being wired (verified via logs, escalated if skipped). There are no explicit unknowns mentioned, but rather known risks with defined mitigations.\"\n}\n\n**questions**:\n- \"The spec mentions 'quality gates OFF by default' for P0.1 and 'Quality gates disabled; >1 agent rejected' for P0.2, and also 'GR-001 Enforcement' in acceptance criteria. Is there a default configuration for quality gates, and if so, how is it verified they are off for this dogfooding?\"\n- \"How specifically do we 'examine Stage0 logs/output for `tier2_used=true`'? Where are these logs located or what command generates them?\"\n\n\n## Consensus Summary\n\n- Synthesized from 1 agent responses\n- All agents completed successfully\n",
