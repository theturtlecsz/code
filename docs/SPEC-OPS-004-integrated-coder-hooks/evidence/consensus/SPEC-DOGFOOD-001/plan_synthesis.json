Stage0 must query NotebookLM for Divine Truth synthesis. `TASK_BRIEF.md` and `DIVINE_TRUTH.md` must be generated in `docs/SPEC-DOGFOOD-001/evidence/`. A system pointer memory with `system:true` tag related to the spec must be stored in local-memory. `code doctor` must show all health checks as `[OK]` with no `stage0.toml` warning. Logs of `/speckit.auto SPEC-DOGFOOD-001` must show `tier2_used=true`. Quality gates with >1 agent are rejected with GR-001 errors. `/speckit.auto` should spawn only canonical pipeline agents (no surprise fan-out). Slash command execution must be single-shot. Dependencies (local-memory daemon, NotebookLM service, `stage0.toml` at `~/.config/codex/stage0.toml`, NotebookLM sources) must be `OK`.\"\n}\n- {\n  \"topic\": \"Related files/modules/tests\",\n  \"details\": \"Related files/modules/tests include: `docs/SPEC-DOGFOOD-001/spec.md`, `~/.config/codex/stage0.toml`, the `docs/SPEC-DOGFOOD-001/evidence/` directory for artifact output, the local-memory database, the Stage0 engine and NotebookLM service components, and the `code doctor`, `lm health`, and `lm search` commands.\"\n}\n- {\n  \"topic\": \"Potential risks or unknowns\",\n  \"details\": \"Potential risks include NotebookLM rate limiting (Tier2 fails closed; Tier1 continues), memory pressure on service (monitor via health endpoint; service auto-recovers), and Stage0 engine not being wired (verify via logs; escalate if skipped). The status for prerequisite P0.4 (Constitution gate satisfied: DB bootstrap complete) is `⏳ Verify with code doctor`, indicating a pending check or unknown.\"\n}\n\n**questions**:\n- \"What is the expected content or format of `TASK_BRIEF.md` and `DIVINE_TRUTH.md` artifacts, beyond 'synthesized context from project docs'?\"\n- \"How can we reliably check for the `tier2_used=true` indicator in Stage0 logs? Is there a specific log file or output stream to monitor?\"\n- \"What are the exact criteria for 'human-readable' evidence artifacts?\"\n- \"What specific output from `code doctor` confirms the 'Constitution gate satisfied: DB bootstrap complete' for prerequisite P0.4?\"\n- \"Are there any specific scenarios or edge cases for `/speckit.auto` that might lead to 'surprise fan-out' or 'duplicate dispatches' that we should be particularly aware of during validation?\"\n\n\n## Consensus Summary\n\n- Synthesized from 1 agent responses\n- All agents completed successfully\n",
