Key constraints include: `code doctor` showing all [OK] (P0.4: Constitution gate satisfied, no `stage0.toml` warning, local-memory, NotebookLM, notebook-mapping all OK). `TASK_BRIEF.md` and `DIVINE_TRUTH.md` must be generated in `docs/SPEC-DOGFOOD-001/evidence/`. Local-memory must store a `system:true` tagged entry for the spec (`A4: System Pointer`). Logs must indicate `tier2_used=true` (`A2: Tier2 Used`). The system must enforce GR-001 (no multi-agent debate) and ensure single-shot slash command dispatch (`P0.1`, `P0.2`, `P0.3`, `A5`, `A6`). Configuration uses `~/.config/codex/stage0.toml`.\"\n}\n- {\n  \"topic\": \"Related Files/Modules/Tests\",\n  \"details\": \"Relevant files and commands include: `~/.config/codex/stage0.toml` (configuration), `docs/SPEC-DOGFOOD-001/evidence/` (artifact output), `code doctor` (health check command), `lm search` (local-memory query), and `/speckit.auto` (the primary execution command). The Stage0 engine, local-memory daemon, and NotebookLM service are critical components involved in the flow.\"\n}\n- {\n  \"topic\": \"Potential Risks or Unknowns\",\n  \"details\": \"Potential risks identified are NotebookLM rate limiting (mitigation: Tier2 fails closed), memory pressure on the service (mitigation: monitor health endpoint), and Stage0 engine not being correctly wired (mitigation: verify via logs). An unknown is the specific mechanism for 'quality gate agents' mentioned in `A5`.\"\n}\n\n**questions**:\n- \"What specific log file or output stream should be explicitly monitored for the `tier2_used=true` indicator during `/speckit.auto` execution?\"\n- \"Is there a predefined structure or minimum content expected for `DIVINE_TRUTH.md` beyond its mere existence?\"\n- \"Could you provide a template or example of the expected `system:true` tagged memory entry for `lm search \\\"SPEC-DOGFOOD-001\\\"` validation?\"\n- \"Where are the 'quality gate agents' defined and how are they explicitly enabled/disabled, as referenced in acceptance criterion `A5`?\"\n\n\n## Consensus Summary\n\n- Synthesized from 1 agent responses\n- All agents completed successfully\n",
