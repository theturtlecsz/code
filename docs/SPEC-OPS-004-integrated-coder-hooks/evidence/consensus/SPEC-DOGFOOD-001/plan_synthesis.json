Key technical checks include `code doctor` health status, Stage0 log output (`tier2_used=true`), successful generation of `TASK_BRIEF.md` and `DIVINE_TRUTH.md` in `docs/SPEC-DOGFOOD-001/evidence/`, and the presence of a `system:true` tagged memory in local-memory for `SPEC-DOGFOOD-001`. Prerequisites include a healthy local-memory daemon, authenticated NotebookLM service with 5 core documentation sources, and an existing `~/.config/codex/stage0.toml` configured for Tier2.\"\n}\n- {\n  \"topic\": \"Related Files/Modules/Tests\",\n  \"details\": \"Relevant components include the `code doctor` utility, `/speckit.auto` command, `~/.config/codex/stage0.toml` configuration, the Stage0 engine, local-memory daemon, NotebookLM service (ID: `4e80974f-789d-43bd-abe9-7b1e76839506`), and the `lm search` command. Output artifacts like `TASK_BRIEF.md` and `DIVINE_TRUTH.md` are expected within `docs/SPEC-DOGFOOD-001/evidence/`.\"\n}\n- {\n  \"topic\": \"Potential Risks or Unknowns\",\n  \"details\": \"Potential risks include NotebookLM rate limiting, which should result in Tier2 failing closed while Tier1 continues. Memory pressure on the service is a concern, with auto-recovery as a mitigation. A critical unknown is whether the Stage0 engine is correctly wired to execute the full pipeline, requiring log verification and escalation if skipped.\"\n}\n\n**questions**:\n- \"What specific content and quality criteria are expected for the generated `TASK_BRIEF.md` and `DIVINE_TRUTH.md` artifacts, beyond being human-readable and synthesized?\"\n- \"Where precisely in the Stage0 logs should the `tier2_used=true` or similar indicator be located, and what are all acceptable 'similar indicators'?\"\n- \"What is the expected structure or content of the system pointer memory stored in local-memory, apart from its existence and the `system:true` tag?\"\n\n\n## Consensus Summary\n\n- Synthesized from 1 agent responses\n- All agents completed successfully\n",
