The implementation has a critical blocking issue: the codebase fails to compile due to a non-exhaustive pattern match in codex-tui2 (ReasoningEffort::XHigh not covered). The specification required Stage0 routing validation, Tier2 (NotebookLM) integration, and dead code cleanup. Sessions 18-26 completed: (1) 2,343 LOC deleted in dead code cleanup with passing tests; (2) comprehensive trace debugging added to diagnose Stage0 routing issues; (3) fallback panic detection implemented. However, the implement stage verdict shows planned work includes: fixing Stage0 routing logic, verifying tier2_used flag, removing debug trace files, and completing dead code audit for native_consensus_executor.rs and config_reload.rs. The acceptance criteria validation plan (A0-A6) was defined but execution status is incomplete. Current blockers: (1) Build fails on unhandled ReasoningEffort::XHigh variant; (2) Stage0 routing behavior unclear (trace logging suggests execution skipped); (3) Dead code audit Phase 2 candidates not yet verified and deleted; (4) Debug trace file (/tmp/stage0-trace.log) not yet cleaned. The cost summary shows $0.00 spent against $2.00 budget with 21 calls, suggesting underutilization of the pipeline for actual implementation work.\n\n**readiness_assessment**:\nNOT READY. Critical blocker: compilation failure. Secondary blockers: Stage0 routing unresolved, dead code audit incomplete, debug trace not removed, acceptance criteria validation incomplete. The specification was well-structured with clear objectives (no fan-out, doctor readiness, Tier2 integration, evidence generation, system pointer storage, GR-001 enforcement) but implementation execution stalled at the Phase 2 dead code audit step. Work progressed through architecture and planning phases but did not complete the critical implementation and validation phases needed for production readiness.\n\n**safeguards**:\n- \"DO NOT MERGE to main until compilation error is resolved (XHigh variant match in codex-tui2/lib.rs)\"\n- \"DO NOT SHIP until Stage0 routing is verified working (currently unclear if execute_stage0 is being called)\"\n- \"DO NOT SHIP until dead code audit Phase 2 is completed (native_consensus_executor.rs, config_reload.rs verified and deleted)\"\n- \"DO NOT SHIP until acceptance criteria A0-A6 are validated with documented test results (currently only test plan exists)\"\n- \"DO NOT SHIP until debug trace logging is removed from production code (/tmp/stage0-trace.log references in stage0_integration.rs)\"\n- \"VERIFY: All 543 lib tests + 34 integration tests pass after fixing compilation error\"\n- \"VERIFY: cargo clippy --workspace shows 0 warnings before merge\"\n- \"REQUIRE: Code review of Stage0 routing logic (pipeline_coordinator.rs lines 220-450) to confirm execution flow\"\n\n**followups**:\n- \"Fix compilation error: add ReasoningEffort::XHigh pattern to match statement in codex-tui2 (lib.rs line ~44)\"\n- \"Investigate Stage0 routing: verify execute_stage0() is called during /speckit.auto SPEC-DOGFOOD-001 invocation (add telemetry if needed)\"\n- \"Complete dead code audit Phase 2: run cargo clippy --workspace -- -W dead_code, verify native_consensus_executor.rs and config_reload.rs are truly unused, delete with incremental commits\"\n- \"Remove debug trace logging: clean /tmp/stage0-trace.log references from stage0_integration.rs after root cause is identified\"\n- \"Execute acceptance criteria validation (A0-A6 test scenarios) and document results in SPEC-DOGFOOD-001/evidence/\"\n- \"Run full test suite and verify all 543+ tests pass before marking complete\"\n- \"Update HANDOFF.md with Session 26 outcomes: compilation status, Stage0 diagnosis results, dead code audit findings, blockers resolved\"\n\n\n## Consensus Summary\n\n- Synthesized from 1 agent responses\n- All agents completed successfully\n",
