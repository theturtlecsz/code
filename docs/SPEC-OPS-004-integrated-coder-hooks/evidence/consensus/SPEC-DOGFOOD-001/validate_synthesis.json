validates evidence artifact generation from Stage0 execution\"\n}\n- {\n  \"requirement\": \"A4: System Pointer - lm search 'SPEC-DOGFOOD-001' returns memory with system:true tag\",\n  \"test_scenarios\": [\n    \"Run 'lm search \\\"SPEC-DOGFOOD-001\\\"' after /speckit.auto completes\",\n    \"Verify at least one result is returned\",\n    \"Parse result and verify it contains 'system:true' tag in metadata\",\n    \"Confirm memory entry references Stage0 execution and has canonical type (e.g., 'milestone')\"\n  ],\n  \"coverage\": \"Complete coverage of Objective #3;

validates single-shot slash command dispatch behavior\"\n}\n\n**gaps**:\n- \"No explicit test scenario for Tier1 (local-memory) fallback behavior when Tier2 (NotebookLM) is unavailable; assumes Tier2 success path only\"\n- \"Missing test for edge case: notebook mapping resolution when domain is not explicitly configured in stage0.toml\"\n- \"No performance baseline specified; 'synthesized context' verification is qualitative; consider adding: TASK_BRIEF.md must contain ≥3 citation refs and ≥500 tokens\"\n- \"No test for concurrent /speckit.auto invocations (stress test for re-entry guard)\"\n- \"Missing test for recovery path: what happens if NotebookLM becomes unavailable mid-pipeline (timeout, graceful degradation)\"\n- \"Evidence artifacts location hardcoded to docs/SPEC-DOGFOOD-001/evidence/; no test for custom evidence directory configuration\"\n- \"No validation of synthesized evidence quality (e.g., citation accuracy, factual correctness of synthesized context)\"\n\n**recommendations**:\n- \"Add quantitative acceptance criterion: TASK_BRIEF.md must contain ≥500 tokens and ≥3 citations from NotebookLM sources\"\n- \"Add Tier1 fallback test: disable NotebookLM and verify /speckit.auto completes with Tier1-only evidence (local-memory)\"\n- \"Add concurrent execution test: invoke /speckit.auto twice in rapid succession and verify re-entry guard prevents race condition\"\n- \"Add timeout resilience test: simulate NotebookLM latency (10s+) and verify Stage0 handles gracefully (timeout vs. wait)\"\n- \"Consider adding automated evidence quality check: parse DIVINE_TRUTH.md and verify it references specific code lines or architectural decisions from project\"\n- \"Add configuration sensitivity test: verify stage0.toml domain mapping works for 'spec-kit' and 'code' domains specifically\"\n- \"Consider adding: Test with NotebookLM service stopped to validate Tier1 fallback path and error messaging\"\n\n\n## Consensus Summary\n\n- Synthesized from 1 agent responses\n- All agents completed successfully\n",
