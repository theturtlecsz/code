  "output_markdown": "# Plan: SPEC-DOGFOOD-001\n\n**Stage**: Audit\n**Agents**: 1\n**Generated**: 2025-12-26 13:58 UTC\n\n## Risks (from claude)\n\n- **Risk**: NotebookLM re-authentication may be required if session expired\n  - Mitigation: Session 25 plan addresses this as Phase 1 (blocking). Implement browser-based re-auth flow per CLAUDE.md MCP authentication guidance. Service has graceful fallback to Tier1 (local-memory) if Tier2 unavailable.\n- **Risk**: Evidence artifacts (A3/A4) require interactive pipeline execution\n  - Mitigation: Session 25 Phase 2-3 covers interactive testing. Evidence directory (`docs/SPEC-DOGFOOD-001/evidence/`) will be populated during actual `/speckit.auto` invocation. No blocking infrastructure issue.\n- **Risk**: Stage0 skip-reason visibility is recent (commit 342244b06 from 2 hours ago)\n  - Mitigation: Change is minimal (+36 lines in pipeline_coordinator.rs), isolated to TUI display layer, test-verified via spec_prompts tests. No risk to core logic.\n- **Risk**: GR-001 enforcement (A5) requires active quality gate configuration\n  - Mitigation: Code properly rejects >1-agent quality gates per GR-001. Acceptance criterion A5 validation depends on user attempting non-compliant configuration (edge case, not blocking production use).\n\n## Consensus Summary\n\n- Synthesized from 1 agent responses\n- All agents completed successfully\n",
