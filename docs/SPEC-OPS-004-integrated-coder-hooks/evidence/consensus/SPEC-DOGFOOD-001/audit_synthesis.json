Verify fix via RUST_LOG=debug build and interactive test of /speckit.auto SPEC-DOGFOOD-001 command. Session 25 Phase 1 covers interactive acceptance validation.\n- **Risk**: NotebookLM session expiration during production use\n  - Mitigation: Code implements graceful fallback to Tier1 (local-memory). Authentication handled via Chrome profile per CLAUDE.md MCP guidance. Session 25 plan includes re-auth verification and headless server support documentation.\n- **Risk**: Evidence artifact generation (A3/A4 acceptance criteria) requires interactive pipeline execution\n  - Mitigation: Evidence directory structure is prepared; artifacts populate during actual /speckit.auto invocation. Session 25 Phase 2-3 includes full interactive test run to verify artifact generation and system pointer storage in local-memory.\n- **Risk**: GR-001 quality gate compliance depends on user configuration not exceeding 1-agent limit\n  - Mitigation: Code enforces this constraint programmatically in spec_kit modules. Acceptance criterion A5 validates via configuration attempt; edge case only affects non-compliant user setup, not core pipeline.\n- **Risk**: Cost tracking shows $0 spent with $2 budget - evidence collection may be incomplete\n  - Mitigation: Cost tracking is functional (call_count=3, duration=87s); $0 cost suggests testing-only invocations. Production deployment will track actual API calls. Budget is conservative for full pipeline execution.\n\n## Consensus Summary\n\n- Synthesized from 1 agent responses\n- All agents completed successfully\n",
