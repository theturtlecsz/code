Continue investigation focusing on ChatWidget::handle_message, AppEvent enum dispatch, and config-driven command overrides. Add regression test case for /speckit.auto routing to prevent future silent skip bugs.\n- **Risk**: NotebookLM session expiration during production use would prevent Tier2 queries\n  - Mitigation: Code implements graceful fallback to Tier1 (local-memory). Authentication handled via Chrome profile per CLAUDE.md MCP guidance. Recommend: validate session freshness before marking Tier2 complete (re-auth if cookie >24h old) before merge.\n- **Risk**: Evidence artifact generation (A3/A4 acceptance criteria) requires Stage0 to execute correctly\n  - Mitigation: Evidence directory structure prepared; artifacts will populate during actual /speckit.auto invocation once routing bug is fixed. After fix, run full interactive test to verify artifact generation and system pointer storage in local-memory.\n- **Risk**: GR-001 quality gate compliance depends on user configuration not exceeding 1-agent limit\n  - Mitigation: Code enforces this constraint programmatically in spec_kit modules. Acceptance criterion A5 validates via configuration; edge case only affects non-compliant user setup, not core pipeline. No action required.\n- **Risk**: Cost tracking shows $0 spent with $2 budget - evidence collection may be incomplete\n  - Mitigation: Cost tracking is functional (call_count=21, duration=514s); $0 cost suggests testing-only invocations or cached responses. Production deployment will track actual API calls. Budget is conservative for full pipeline execution. No action required.\n\n## Consensus Summary\n\n- Synthesized from 1 agent responses\n- All agents completed successfully\n",
