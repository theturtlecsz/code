# Spec: Local-memory Migration (T10)

## Context
- Byterover memories still hold the canonical backlog of Spec Kit decisions and telemetry, while local-memory is intended to be the single source of truth.
- Guardrails require every Byterover lookup to be mirrored into local-memory, but today the workflow depends on manual discipline rather than tooling.
- Multi-agent slash commands fetch context from Byterover and persist outputs inconsistently, producing drift that blocks downstream automation such as the nightly sync detector (T15).

## Objectives
1. Provide a deterministic migration path that copies existing Byterover memories into local-memory domains (spec-tracker, impl-notes, docs-ops, infra-ci, governance) without data loss.
2. Update Planner CLI/TUI flows so local-memory is the primary read/write store and Byterover is only used as a fallback when a key is genuinely absent.
3. Capture the migration and new write-back hooks in documentation so operators can rerun the sync, audit results, and understand domain mappings.

## Scope
- Implement automation (CLI command or script) that extracts Byterover notes via MCP, normalises metadata (domain, tags, importance), and writes them into the local-memory SQLite database.
- Extend runtime integrations (slash commands, consensus collection, Spec Ops hooks) to read from local-memory first, then invoke Byterover only when local entries are missing, persisting any fallback results back to local-memory.
- Provide idempotent migration reports (counts per domain, mismatches) and expose logs/evidence under `docs/SPEC-OPS-004-integrated-coder-hooks/evidence/commands/SPEC-KIT-010/`.
- Document runbooks: how to execute the migration, how to verify tags/domains, how to triage conflicts.

## Non-Goals
- Replacing or redesigning the Byterover MCP service itself.
- Building a UI for local-memory inspection beyond existing CLI utilities.
- Handling non-Spec Kit knowledge domains outside the five core categories listed above.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Migration command copies all current Byterover memories into local-memory with preserved IDs (or deterministic slugs), domains, tags, and timestamps. A dry-run mode summarises planned changes.
- Slash command orchestration, consensus verdict storage, and `/spec-*` prompt hydration fetch from local-memory first and only call Byterover when local results are missing, automatically storing any fallback output in local-memory.
- Migration produces a machine-readable report (JSON) and human summary attached as evidence under `docs/SPEC-OPS-004-integrated-coder-hooks/evidence/commands/SPEC-KIT-010/` with counts per domain and any conflicts/resolutions recorded.
- Documentation updates (README/AGENTS/RESTART or dedicated doc) describe the migration workflow, domain mapping, and the policy for keeping local-memory authoritative.
