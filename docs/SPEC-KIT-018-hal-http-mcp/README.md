# HAL Integration Templates

This directory contains reusable scaffolding for wiring the HAL HTTP MCP into projects that use the upstream repository toolchain. All values are placeholders—projects must copy these files into their own repositories (for example `~/kavedarr`) and fill in concrete hosts, secrets, and request payloads.

## Files
- `spec.md` / `plan.md` / `tasks.md`: governance artifacts describing the template workstream (no project-specific data).
- `hal_config.template.md`: example `[mcp_servers.hal]` block for `~/.code/config.toml` with placeholder environment variables.
- `requests.template.json`: sample HAL request definitions (health, authenticated REST, GraphQL) using `{secrets.HAL_SECRET_API_KEY}` and other placeholders.

## How to Use in a Project
1. Copy the template files into your project repo (e.g., `~/kavedarr/docs/hal/`).
2. Generate or retrieve the project API key. Store it in the MCP secret store as `HAL_SECRET_API_KEY` (never commit it) and record bootstrap/rotation steps in the project docs.
3. Set concrete values for `HAL_BASE_URL`, `HAL_DEFAULT_HEADERS`, or override via `HAL_PROFILE`. Update the copied request JSON with project-specific paths and bodies.
4. Register the HAL profile in the project’s Codex config (or export `HAL_PROFILE`).
5. Capture HAL evidence files alongside the project (not in this repo).

> Never commit real API keys, hosts, or project-specific payloads back into this template repository.
