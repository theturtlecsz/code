**research_summary**:
- {
  "topic": "Technical Requirements and Constraints",
  "details": "The workload requires validation of the full golden path: `/speckit.auto` invoking Stage0 with Tier1 (local-memory) + Tier2 (NotebookLM). Key objectives include confirming NotebookLM query and contribution to Divine Truth, verifying `TASK_BRIEF.md` and `DIVINE_TRUTH.md` generation, and validating system pointer memory storage with a `system:true` tag. Prerequisites include the code TUI (`~/code`) as the default workflow, healthy local-memory daemon and authenticated NotebookLM service, and a `~/.config/codex/stage0.toml` configured for Tier2. Constraints include adherence to P0 prerequisites like no surprise fan-out (GR-001 compliance), single-shot dispatch, and a satisfied Constitution gate. This validation focuses solely on Stage0, not downstream pipeline stages or performance."
}
- {
  "topic": "Related Files/Modules/Tests",
  "details": "Relevant components include the code TUI (`~/code`), Stage0 configuration (`~/.config/codex/stage0.toml`), and the expected evidence output directory (`docs/SPEC-DOGFOOD-001/evidence/`). Testing involves using `code doctor` for health checks, executing `/speckit.auto SPEC-DOGFOOD-001`, and querying local-memory with `lm search` for system pointers."
}
- {
  "topic": "Potential Risks or Unknowns",
  "details": "Risks identified are NotebookLM rate limiting (mitigated by Tier2 failing closed), memory pressure on the service (mitigated by monitoring and auto-recovery), and Stage0 engine not being wired (mitigated by log verification). A noted unknown is that approach suggestions will be generated by Tier 2 in V1.5, implying current planning should not preempt this."
}

**questions**:
- "What is the specific output from `code doctor` that signifies a 'Constitution gate satisfied: DB bootstrap complete' status?"
- "What is the exact string or pattern to search for in Stage0 logs to confirm 'tier2_used=true' or a similar indicator of Tier2 usage?"
- "Are there any specific content requirements or expected structure for `TASK_BRIEF.md` and `DIVINE_TRUTH.md` beyond their mere existence?"
- "Is there a prescribed format or additional content expected for the system pointer memory stored in local-memory, beyond just the `system:true` tag?"
